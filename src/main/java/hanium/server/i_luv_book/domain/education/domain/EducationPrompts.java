            - Children of this age start English educationally for the first time.

            3. High-Level (11-13 years old)
            - Children of this age should learn basic English abilities like vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills overall.
            - It is time to prepare for preparation and preparation to enter middle school, so educational words would be good to study for Korean middle school English.
